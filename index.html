            <h2 class="mainHeading">H&M scandal</h2>
            <p>
                Famous fashion company H&M came under fire in January 2018 for an ad that featured a black child wearing
                a
                sweatshirt with the words “coolest monkey in the jungle.” The ad caused public outrage over social media
                because of its racist content. The #coolestmonkeyinthejungle has stormed the internet, drawing
                widespread
                public accusation and debate.
                By observing the social phenomena caused by this scandal, it is clear that the world has entered a new
                age
                of media activism. But what does it mean?

            <p>
                Media activism describes many types of activism that use media; activism based on video, audio, and
                websites
                are all types of media activism. Yet, social media remains the most vital form of media activism!
                The famous social event Black Lives Matter is the most outstanding example of effective media activism
                in
                recent decades.

                The data underneath demonstrates a close look at the Google query numbers relating to the Black
                Lives
                Matter movement. The number of queries skyrocketed in 2020 after the police murder of George
                Floyd.
                Despite
                the fact this movement existed as early as 2013, the 2020 protests achieved unparalleled success
                due to
                the
                use of media activism. Therefore, BLM remains the most potent demonstration of media activism,
                as social
                platforms can change the political and social environment. Civilians now have the power to unite
                against
                government or corporate organizations that have committed immoral crimes against the people.
                Media
                activism
                for the right cause can be considered the positive aspect of this phenomenon, but what about the
                negative?
                Media activism is the new reality, and its popularity and presence continue to grow with the
                popularity
                of
                social platforms.

            <p>
                It is also essential to look at the possibility of cyberbullying caused by media activism. The graph on
                the here is based on the comments gathered from Twitter and Facebook in 2021, the two most popular
                platforms for media activism. By observing the ratio between abusive and average tweets, it is
                frightening
                to see the number of abusive tweets approaching the usual comments.
                The proactive nature of media activism might result in extremist ideas, and innocent civilians might
                become
                the target of attack. It is essential to find ways to protect the safety of the innocent while the
                popularity of media activism grows.
                But even so, media activism still serves its purpose; the H&M incident remains an example of this.

            <p>
                It is essential to know the outrage behind the H&M scandal is based on a real-life tragedy in which H&M
                has
                participated. H&M is among the top 20 most profitable fashion companies in the globe. Yet, there has
                been
                proof that H&M is participating in labor abuse happening in Asia and Africa. Workers in H&M have
                revealed
                labor law violations and cheap labor in the H&M supply chain (Campaign, 2018). Therefore, for H&M to use
                “coolest monkey in the jungle” in their ad goes beyond racial discrimination. It helped more people
                realize
                the corporate exploitation of ethnic minorities!
                “Fashion industry benefits from cheap labor of ethnic minorities!”
                The graph on the right-hand side shows the global purchase power of 100 countries in 2023. Africa and
                Asia
                show a dark red, meaning ethnic minorities are still suffering from low income and extreme poverty.
                Under such circumstances, H&M shows extreme racial insensitivity, considering how much profit they have
                already exploited from ethnic minorities.

                This graph shows the yearly operating profit of H&M. The number shows a clear drop in 2018, the year of

                However, this isn’t the only data that shows the financial consequences of H&M caused by media activism.
                This graph shows the yearly global brand value of H&M; the brand demonstrates an apparent decline in
                global
                value after the 2018 incident.

                Finally, the last graph shows the sales numbers of H&M in SEK. H&M suffered a financial hit in 2017 and
                2018. The public shaming caused by media activism has upset the economic status of the fashion giant.
                Soon
                after the incident, H&M apologized for their offensive ad regarding ethnic minorities.
